# Who's Using Jasmine?

## Count it Down

This is my entry in the 10K Apart Challenge. It is a countdown clock. Enter a clock title and an end date and time and
it will count it down for you. It sports smooth clock animations, before specific digits change they will flash red,
and you can share your clock w/ friends through a url generated by your title and end date and time.

Jasmine was essential in this project. First I wrote all the specs for an uncompressed version. When it was time to
compress every little bit of code, I updated my specs w/ the renaming and refactoring for a smaller size. It was very
intense, for example the Clock class because just 'K' and all the jquery methods were aliased to 'a' or 'rc' or 'x'.
Without Jasmine double checking all of my renaming, I would have gone insane.

## Weplay

Weplay aims to be the online home of youth sports. Our users are coaches, players, and parents involved in team sports
including soccer, football, baseball, cheerleading and more. We provide tools including scheduling, messaging,
photo/video sharing and virtual awards, for coaches and parents to organize their team's online  presence. Our younger
users also use Weplay to engage with their friends, play games, and earn incentives. A vibrant community is also
emerging around our offerings for Skills & Drills and Questions & Answers.

Our platform is built on Ruby and Rails and our development practices are based largely on Agile and behavior driven
development. While Cucumber and RSpec have been our primary testing tools for driving our server-side development since
our beginning nearly three years ago, we have had to evolve our front-end testing solution. We started with no testing
and eventually incorporated Selenium feature testing into our Cucumber build. I've led the efforts to applying
test-driven javascript coding practices, originally with ScrewUnit + Screwdriver, then BlueRidge and now Jasmine.

A recent contribution to our Weplay fork of jasmine is the ability to specify Sprocket-style "require" lines
(i.e., <code>//= "public/javascript/awesome.js"</code>) to target src javascript files on a per-spec basis.
