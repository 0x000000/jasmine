Jasmine  
=======
**yet another JavaScript testing framework**

The Problem
-----------

There are some situations when you want to test-drive JavaScript, but you don't want to be bothered with or even have an explicit document.  You have no DOM to work with and so don't have HTML elements on which to hang events handlers.  You may need to make asynchronous calls (say, to an AJAX API) and cannot mock/stub them.  

But you still need to write tests.

What's an Agile Engineer to do?

The Solution
------------

Enter Jasmine.

Jasmine is yet another JavaScript testing framework.  It's *heavily* influenced by [RSpec]() & [JSpec](http://github.com/visionmedia/jspec/tree/master),
