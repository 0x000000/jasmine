# Quick Start

## For JavaScript-only projects:
1. Get the latest standalone release from the [downloads page](index.html).
2. Open `SpecRunner.html` in your favorite browser.

## Other distributions:
* For integration with the Ruby environment, including automated execution with Selenium, please use the [jasmine gem](http://github.com/pivotal/jasmine-gem).

# Which Release Should I Use?

Please use the latest version unless you have a good reason not to. Some of this documentation may not be applicable to older versions. Please see [Release Notes](release-notes.html) for change information.

# How To

There is a simple example of how to use Jasmine in the /example directory, but here's more information.
